          Hey there! I'm Arjun, a Computer Science major at UIUC with a love for
          solving complex problems and creating impactful projects. Whether it's
          coding late into the night or brainstorming another cool project to
          create, I'm always looking for ways to push boundaries and innovate.
          Outside of tech, you'll probably find me weightlifting or playing the
          piano. Thanks for stopping by—let’s build something amazing!
